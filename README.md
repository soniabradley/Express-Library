# Built With

 * [HTTP]() Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.  An HTTP session is a sequence of network request=response transactions. An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to a particular port on a server (typically port 80, occasionally port 8080; see List of TCP and UDP port numbers). An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", and a message of its own. The body of this message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned.[1]

* [Get]() Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.

* [Model](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/installation/getting-started.html) A Model represents a table in the database. Instances of this class represent a database row.
